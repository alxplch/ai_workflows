# AI use case #1: Using AI as an advisor to find your dream role

**Source: Torsten Walbaum, https://substack.com/@torstenw/p-172994271**

Almost everyone I know in tech that loves their job got it through some sort of coincidence. They met someone who had an interesting job and applied for similar roles, or they took an internal transfer opportunity to another team.

That’s not crazy if you consider that most tech roles are fairly new and university career advisory programs etc. don’t really know much about them. But in the age of AI, we don’t have to wait for serendipity anymore and can take a more intentional approach.

As long as you share the** ** *right context* , AI chatbots are great at giving you targeted recommendations for roles you might like. Here’s a template you can try (just replace the parts in** ****bold** with your information):

### Prompt

```
I'm currently a [current or previous role] at a [type of current or previous company]; my resume is attached. I like parts of my job like [things you enjoy], but am frustrated by [things that drain your energy].What career paths could I pursue from here where I can double down on my strengths but can address some of the pain points listed above? Please ask me questions for more context as needed to give a customized answer.
```


## AI use case #2: Ask AI to review & optimize your LinkedIn profile

Having an up-to-date, optimized LinkedIn profile is helpful for at least two reasons:

1. You might get “inbound” job opportunities, i.e. recruiters might find your profile and reach out proactively
2. Hiring managers often take a quick look at it when screening resumes

If you’re like me, though, you probably hate keeping your profile up to date. Luckily, you can massively reduce the time it takes by asking AI to review and feedback your profile and then implementing the handful of suggestions that seem most promising.

A simple prompt like this will already give you plenty to work with:

> *I am currently looking for** ****[type of role you’re targeting]** opportunities. Please review my LinkedIn profile** ****([your LinkedIn profile URL])** and suggest opportunities for improvement that would increase my chances of getting inbound job offers from hiring managers or recruiters.*
>
> *I also attached screenshots of my profile in case you cannot access it on LinkedIn.*

When I did this for my profile, Perplexity** **[correctly concluded](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-am-currently-looking-for-dir-.ySeorkfS8eI07D.kh5SPA) that I was missing key pieces; e.g. I wasn’t highlighting all relevant skills or properly showcasing the impact I drove in my past roles.

**Note:** Since the AI is trained on a lot of influencer content, it tends to include a few suggestions that are not to everybody’s taste (e.g. I don’t want to use a super long “influencer-style” headline like Perplexity proposed).

Just pick the pieces that you’re comfortable with and can implement with reasonable effort.



### AI use case #8: Researching the interview process

The second important area you should dig into is the interview process itself. Especially if you’re applying for larger companies that have been around for a while, there will be a lot of information online that AI can find.

Here’s how you can get an actionable overview via the** ***Deep Research *feature in the tool of your choice:

> *`<goal>` Please create an in-depth report on the interview process for** ****[type of role you’re interviewing for]** roles at** ** **[company]** . `</goal>`*
>
> *`<content>` Please cover at a minimum:*
>
> *- How many rounds and what types of interviews the process typically entails, and who I’d likely be speaking with in addition to the hiring manager*
>
> *- Questions that have been asked in the past*
>
> *- Whether any take-home exercises seem to have been used*
>
> *- Whether interviews are typically remote or on-site*
>
> *- How long it took for people to hear back `</content>`*
>
> *`<instructions>`*
>
> *- Prioritize information from 2025 wherever possible*
>
> *- Highlight any variance in what people report*
>
> *- If you can’t find information on something, clearly say that – don’t make things up. It’s fine to make reasonable assumptions or inferences based on available information as long as you clearly state them*
>
> *- Aim for a high level of detail and at least 3,000 words `</instructions>`*

Now, instead of browsing dozens of websites or forum posts, you can just read one single, dense report:
